📊 Candlestick Charts Generator
This project, written in C++, generates a simple ASCII candlestick chart based on CSV data. The chart is saved as a text file (chart.txt).

🛠️ How it works
The program reads data from a CSV file (e.g., intc_us_data.csv) and displays an ASCII candlestick chart corresponding to stock price data. Each candle represents one trading day.
